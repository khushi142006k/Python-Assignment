'''
Problem Statement: A server produces several text log files. Create a program that scans all files in a folder, builds an inverted index
mapping each normalized token to the list of file names and line numbers where it appears, stores the index using pickle, and
compresses both original logs and index into a zip file. The program must also support a search mode that loads the pickle index and
answers token queries.
