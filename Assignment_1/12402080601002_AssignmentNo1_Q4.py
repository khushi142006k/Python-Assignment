'''
Problem Statement: A CSV file contains transaction_id, account_id, type, amount and timestamp. Create a program that reads the file,
validates every row, writes valid credit and debit transactions into separate CSV files, writes rejected rows into error.csv with reason,
and finally prints account-wise balance changes. The program must continue processing after invalid rows using exception handling.
