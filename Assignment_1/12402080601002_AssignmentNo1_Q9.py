'''
Problem Statement: Simulate a job scheduler where each job has job_id, priority, duration and required resource count. Multiple worker
threads execute jobs. Higher priority jobs must be processed first; jobs with same priority use earlier arrival order. The program must
maintain thread-safe job assignment and produce a final execution report.
